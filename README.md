Calculator
==========

Write a program that reads two numbers from the user and then off ers a menu with the four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Once the user has selected an operation from the menu, the calculator performs the operation. Hint: In the same way that there exists an Integer.parseInt() me thod to parse integers, there is a Dou- ble.parseDouble() method to parse real numbers.
